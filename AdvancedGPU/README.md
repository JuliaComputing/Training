# Advanced GPU Computing training

This training focusses on advanced aspects of the Julia GPU computing stack,
using CUDA.jl. It covers:

* Advanced usage of CUDA.jl
    * library integrations and wrappers (CUDA driver API, CUBLAS, etc)
    * programming models (array abstractions, kernels)
    * memory management
    * task-based concurrent GPU computing
* Performance deep-dive
    * application analysis and optimization (using NSight Systems)
    * kernel analysis and optimization (using NSight Compute)
